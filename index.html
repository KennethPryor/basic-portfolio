    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Kenneth Lloyd Pryor.I was born in Deland, Flordia on 01/31/1999 during the Superbowl.I was playing a Harry Potter game on Windows Vista
        before I was even in Pre-K and was always interested in Computers and Technology all together.I graduated Baldwin High School in 2017 and continued 
        my career in the automotive industry.I was talking with my IT Director one day and we talked about coding and some basic stuff and right afterwards I looked 
        up Coding classes and I enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech.<br>
        I'm an outgoing and very social person and love the outdoors, but not afraid to play videogames all weekend.I love the ocean and have a passion for Marine Biology
        and I always dreamed of going shark diving.
